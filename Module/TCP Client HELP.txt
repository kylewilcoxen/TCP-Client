SUMMARY:
This module is a TCP client. By default, module will attempt reconnection if failed.

IP ADDRESS AND PORT (MUST SET BEFORE CONNECTING)
--------------------------------------------------------
Set the IP address and port in the parameter of the module or 
set them from your program with [IP_Address$] and [Port] inputs.

CONNECTING TO A DEVICE
--------------------------------------------------------
After setting IP Address and Port, hold Connect high.
By default the module will reconnect if failed. Set Enable_Reconnect to 
zero or comment out to disable reconnection. Set Connect input to low to
disconnect from the device.

When connection is successful you should see communication from the device using RX$.
Use the TX$ signal to send commands to the device.

CONNECTION FEEDBACK
--------------------------------------------------------
When a valid connection is established to the device, the IsConnected_FB digital signal will go high.
The [Connected_FB] analog signal will then change to 1d. When module is disconnected the analog signal
will change to 0d.

The [Status_FB] values are:
 0d = Not Connected
 1d = Waiting for connection
 2d = Connected
 3d = Connection failed
 4d = Connection broken remotely
 5d = Connection broken locally
 6d = Performing DNS lookup
 7d = DNS lookup failed
 8d = DNS lookup resolved
 9d = Loss of link

DEBUGGING
--------------------------------------------------------
Set the [Debug] signal high to receive debug messages printed to console.
